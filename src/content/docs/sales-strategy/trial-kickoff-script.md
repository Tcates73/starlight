## Part 1: Opening Hook (Validate Pain) - 5 Minutes

**Objective:** Get them to say "YES, that's exactly our problem"

### Script

> **"Thank you for joining. I know your desk is currently covered in compliance documents and staffing reports. You're increasing per-pupil spending, you're working harder than ever, yet Oklahoma's ranking is 50th."**

> **"Here is the blunt truth: You have a time theft problem."**

> **"Your rock star teachers spend 75% of their time grading, reporting, and managing administrative chaos. They're exhausted. You're exhausted."**

> **"Is that an accurate picture of what's happening on your campus right now?"**

**[PAUSE. Wait for "Yes" response.]**

### Why This Works

- **Buyer Mirroring:** You're reflecting their exact pain, not pitching yet
- **Permission to Complain:** You're giving them space to vent
- **Data Validation:** The 75% statistic gives them language for their frustration
- **Diagnostic Question:** "Is that accurate?" forces them to confirm the problem

### Common Responses & Your Reply

| Their Response | Your Follow-Up |
|---|---|
| **"Yes, exactly. Our teachers are drowning."** | "Tell me more about that. What does 'drowning' look like day-to-day?" (Let them talk for 2-3 minutes) |
| **"It's not quite 75%, but yes, admin work is a huge burden."** | "Even if it's 50%, that's still half their day stolen from instruction. What's the biggest time drain you're seeing?" |
| **"We've tried to address this with [other solution]."** | "What happened? Did it move the needle on teacher time?" (Identify why previous solutions failed) |

## Part 2: Solution Re-Frame (Teacher as Rockstar) - 5 Minutes

**Objective:** Position AI as teacher amplifier, not replacement

### Script

> **"This isn't about buying software to save time. This is about amplifying human connection."**

> **"Our AI has no ego; it exists to be your amplifier. It automates the 75% admin grind so your teachers can focus 100% on the irreplaceable human work: building relationships, inspiring curiosity, and delivering Level 4 differentiated learning."**

> **"We don't replace them—we make them the measurable heroes."**

> **"Let me be very clear about what this AI does and doesn't do:"**

### The AI Does/Doesn't Chart

Use this visual framing (can be a slide or verbal):

| ✅ The AI DOES | ❌ The AI DOESN'T |
|---|---|
| Automate grading of objective assessments | Replace teacher judgment on subjective work |
| Generate differentiated lesson variations | Make instructional decisions |
| Track compliance documentation | Interact directly with students unsupervised |
| Provide real-time data dashboards | Replace the teacher-student relationship |
| Handle administrative reporting | Make high-stakes decisions without human review |

### Key Messaging Points

> **"Every single high-stakes decision—like identifying a struggling student or adapting instruction—goes through your teacher. That's Level 4 Human Oversight, and it's not negotiable."**

> **"What we're doing is giving your teachers a co-pilot for the routine, repetitive work so they can spend their time on what only a human can do: inspire, mentor, and build the relationships that actually drive achievement."**

> **"Does that align with your vision for how AI should support your teachers?"**

**[PAUSE. Wait for affirmative response.]**

## Part 3: Trial Process Overview (14-Day Quick-Win Sprint) - 10 Minutes

**Objective:** Make the trial feel low-risk, high-reward, and concrete

### Script

> **"The goal of this 14-day Quick-Win Sprint is to get you the proof—not promises, proof."**

> **"Our Level 4 Certified Trial Package guarantees two things in the first two weeks:"**

### Guaranteed Deliverable #1: Measurable Teacher Time Savings

> **"First: We deliver a dashboard showing the immediate shift from admin work to direct instruction time."**

> **"Here's how it works:**
> - **Day 1-3:** We audit your current teacher workflows (grading, lesson planning, compliance reporting)
> - **Day 4-7:** We implement AI automation for the highest-burden tasks
> - **Day 8-14:** We measure time savings with before/after metrics"**

> **"At the end of 14 days, you'll see exactly how many hours per week your teachers are getting back. If it's not at least 30% time savings, we extend the trial until we hit that benchmark."**

### Guaranteed Deliverable #2: Board-Ready Achievement Baseline

> **"Second: We collect initial student engagement metrics and achievement data aligned to your state test benchmarks."**

> **"This is critical for your board presentation. You'll have:**
> - Baseline student performance data (pre-trial)
> - Initial engagement metrics (participation, completion rates)
> - Differentiation impact (which students benefited most from AI-generated variations)
> - Compliance documentation (Level 4 Oversight logs, Oklahoma Academic Standards alignment)"**

> **"This data defends your final purchase in the Board meeting. You won't have to say 'We think this will work.' You'll say 'Here's the measurable impact in 14 days.'"**

### Trial Timeline Visual

Walk through this timeline (use a slide or share screen):

```
Day 1: Trial Kick-Off + Workflow Audit
  ↓
Days 2-3: System Setup + Teacher Onboarding
  ↓
Days 4-7: AI Implementation (High-Burden Tasks)
  ↓
Days 8-14: Measurement Period + Data Collection
  ↓
Day 15: Results Review + Board Presentation Prep
```

### Investment & Commitment

> **"The trial investment is [$ amount] or we can apply it to your full implementation if you move forward."**

> **"What we need from your team:**
> - **5-10 teachers** to participate in the pilot (we recommend a mix of veteran and newer teachers)
> - **Access to your curriculum standards** (Oklahoma Academic Standards alignment)
> - **One Tech Director check-in** per week (15 minutes) for system support
> - **Commitment to measure honestly** (we want real data, not sales fluff)"**

> **"Can you commit those resources for the next 14 days?"**

**[PAUSE. Address any concerns about resources/time.]**

## Part 4: Objection Handling - 5 Minutes

**Objective:** Preemptively address common concerns

### Common Objections & Responses

#### Objection 1: "We don't have budget for this right now."

**Response:**
> "I understand. Let's look at it this way: You're already spending money on the problem. Teacher turnover costs $20,000-$30,000 per teacher. If we can reduce turnover by retaining even 2-3 teachers this year, this pays for itself. The trial will give you the data to justify the investment to your board. Plus, we're in Q2—if you secure the data now, you can allocate funds before the fiscal year locks in."

#### Objection 2: "Our teachers are already overwhelmed. We can't add more technology training."

**Response:**
> "That's exactly why we designed this for busy teachers. The onboarding is 30 minutes, max. We're not asking them to learn a new system—we're automating the systems they're already drowning in. And if they don't see immediate time savings in the first week, we adjust or pull back. This is about reducing their workload, not adding to it."

#### Objection 3: "We tried [competitor/other AI tool] and it didn't work."

**Response:**
> "What specifically didn't work—was it the training, the implementation, or the results?" [Listen to their answer.] "Our approach is different because we start with the trial and guarantee measurable results before you commit long-term. Plus, we're purpose-built for Oklahoma compliance (Level 4 Oversight, Oklahoma Academic Standards). Most generic tools don't account for that. Can we prove the difference in 14 days?"

#### Objection 4: "What about data privacy and FERPA compliance?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. All our AI use adheres to the Risk Assessment Matrix and strictly complies with FERPA and COPPA. Critically, we employ a 'Human-in-the-Loop' protocol. This means AI never makes a high-stakes decision on a student without a human educator reviewing and providing final approval. We also provide full compliance documentation for OSDE review. Data privacy isn't an afterthought—it's built into our Level 4 certification."

#### Objection 5: "We need to get board approval first."

**Response:**
> "Absolutely. That's why the trial exists. Most boards won't approve an AI investment without proof, and you shouldn't ask them to. The trial gives you the board-ready metrics to make the case. In 14 days, you'll have teacher time savings data, student engagement metrics, and compliance documentation. That's what gets board approval, not a sales pitch."

### The Ultimate Reframe

If they're still hesitant:

> **"Let me ask you this: If you could know—with certainty—whether AI can solve your teacher burnout problem in 14 days, would that be worth a 30-minute onboarding and a small trial investment? Because that's all I'm asking for. We measure, you decide."**

## Part 5: Next Steps & Commitment - 5 Minutes

**Objective:** Lock in trial start date and logistics

### Script

> **"Alright, let's lock this in. What does your calendar look like for a Trial Kick-Off start date?"**

**[Suggest a date within 7 days. Urgency matters.]**

> **"Here's what happens between now and Day 1:"**

### Pre-Trial Checklist

**Week Before Trial Start:**
1. **Contracts & Legal** (Day -7 to -5)
   - Trial agreement signed
   - FERPA/COPPA compliance review
   - Data security protocols confirmed

2. **Teacher Selection** (Day -5 to -3)
   - Identify 5-10 pilot teachers
   - Send calendar invites for 30-minute onboarding
   - Collect curriculum standards documentation

3. **Technical Setup** (Day -3 to -1)
   - Tech Director call (15 minutes) for system access
   - Integration with existing LMS (if applicable)
   - Dashboard access provisioned

### Confirmation Questions

> **"Before we wrap, let me confirm a few things:"**

1. **"Who are your 5-10 pilot teachers? Should we select a mix of subjects and experience levels?"**
2. **"Who's the point person for technical questions during the trial—you or [Tech Director name]?"**
3. **"When's your next board meeting? That'll help us time the results review perfectly."**
4. **"Any specific pain points you want us to focus on first—grading, lesson planning, compliance reporting?"**

### The Close

> **"I'm excited to get started. Oklahoma teachers deserve to have their time back, and I think we're going to prove that in the next 14 days. I'll send a calendar invite for Day 1 and a pre-trial prep checklist by end of day. Sound good?"**

**[Wait for confirmation.]**

> **"One last thing: If at any point during the trial you feel like this isn't delivering, tell me immediately. I'd rather fix it in real-time than have you suffer through two weeks of something that's not working. Deal?"**

**[Shake hands or confirm verbally.]**
